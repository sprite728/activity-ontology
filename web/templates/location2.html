<div class="well">
    <p class="lead-small">You will be given a location type (e.g., Hospital, Aquarium, etc.) and a description of that location. Write down an activity or event that can occur in that location; that is, write a verb (e.g., go, swim, eat, etc.), and an object (e.g., home, food, etc.) in the two forms.<p>
    <p class="lead-small">Some examples to give you a better idea: at a <i>bowling alley</i> you can <span class="label label-success" style="font-size: 17px">go</span> <span class="label label-info" style="font-size:17px">bowling</span>; at a <i>hospital</i> you can <span class="label label-success" style="font-size:17px">visit</span> <span class="label label-info" style="font-size: 17px">doctor</span>.</p>
    <p class="lead-small">Also specify what you think the average duration of that activity is, as well as whether you can think of any other activities that can occur in that location (no need to name them).</p>    
    <p class="lead-small">Previous responders gave the following examples:</p>
    <ul class="lead-small">
        {% for response in responses %}
        <li><span class="label label-success" style="font-size: 17px">{{ response['predicate'] }}</span> <span class="label label-info" style="font-size: 17px">{{ response['object'] }}</span></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    <p class="lead-small">These cannot be picked again.</p>
